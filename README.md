The objective here was to create a user interface that allows users to input any country as a string and have information about that country rendered back to the user. My goal was to showcase my abilities in developing a responsive and functional user interface, as well as my knowledge of frontend and backend development.

The website features a search bar at the center of the page where the user can enter the name of a country they would like to learn about. Once the user has entered the name and clicked the search button, the website will display information about the country such as its population, capital city, official language, and more.

The information is presented in a clear and concise format, with each piece of information appearing in its own section. The design of the website is user-friendly, with easy-to-read text and a layout that makes it simple to find the information you're looking for.

This website is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about a particular country. Whether you're planning a trip, doing research for a school project, or simply interested in learning about the world, this website is a valuable tool that provides easy access to accurate and up-to-date information.
